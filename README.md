## License Information

SimCenter packages are hosted on [Bintray](https://bintray.com) and
contain Open-Source software which is licensed by the software's
maintainers and NOT Bincrafters.  For each Open-Source package
published by the SimCenter, the packaging process obtains the required
license files along with the original source files from the
maintainer, and includes these license files in the generated Conan
packages.

The contents of this GIT repository are completely separate from the
software being packaged and therefore licensed separately.  The
license for all files contained in this GIT repository are defined in
the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file in this repository.  The licenses
included with all Conan packages published by the SimCenter can be found
in the Conan package directories in the following locations, relative
to the Conan Cache root (`~/.conan` by default).
